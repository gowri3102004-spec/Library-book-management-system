# 📚 Library Management System (Python)

A simple and interactive **Library Management System** built using **Python**.
This project uses **Set Operations** for managing books, issuing, returning, and searching in an efficient way.

---

## 📝 **Introduction**

This Library Management System is a beginner-friendly Python project that helps manage library books digitally.
Users can:

* View available books
* Issue books
* Return books
* Add new books
* Search for a book

The system runs entirely in the terminal and uses Python **set data structure** for fast and unique book handling.

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

The main objectives of this project are:

* To implement a simple library automation system using Python
* To demonstrate how set operations can be used in real-time applications
* To help beginners understand menu-driven program structure
* To manage books without duplicates using sets

## 🧠 **Difficulties Faced**

During development, the following challenges were encountered:

* Managing book states (available vs issued)
* Handling user input errors
* Ensuring no duplicate books are added
* Using set operations effectively
* Designing a clean menu-driven structure

These challenges helped strengthen understanding of Python logic, sets, and input validation.

## 🚀 **Future Updates / Enhancements**

Possible future improvements:

* Add file storage (save books permanently)
* Implement a graphical user interface (GUI)
* Add student IDs and track who issued which book
* Add due date and fine calculation system
* Export reports in text or CSV format
* Add admin login system
